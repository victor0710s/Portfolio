                    <h3>About me...</h3>
                    <p class="biograph">
                        Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Uninter. I'm always working on building my skills through courses and personal projects, even if they are basic. I have some experience in the technology field, having worked as a Junior Support Analyst at Robbyson for 1 year and 9 months. I also work as a musician, which has significantly helped me develop my communication skills and ability to work in a team. At the moment, my goal is to become an excellent developer, keep learning, and grow into a great professional.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>By experience, I worked in a company as a Support Analyst Junior. In this position, I had contact with various areas, which helped me acquire more knowledge, such as Development, QA, Database, Data Science, Infrastructure, UX/UI. The most important thing, I believe, is to understand business rules, because you will know what you're doing in a feature and what its impact will be.
                    That was my first job and I learned a lot.</p>
